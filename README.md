# Python interface for the Reflexxes Motion Libraries

The `setup.py` script will invoke CMake to build the module. The module can thus
be built and installed with e.g.

    pip install --user .

assuming `setup.py` is located in the current working directory.

This library depends on
- python-dev
- libboost-python-dev
- libReflexxesTypeII or libReflexxesTypeIV
